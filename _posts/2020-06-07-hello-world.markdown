> The start of App Explained

Kim and I are happy to announce that we're starting a new project called App Explained. Our mission is to teach the fundamentals of mobile app development to people everywhere. In recent years, Google has added support for the Kotlin programming language in Android Studio and also announced it as the preferred language for Android development. With this in mind, our starting point is to concisely teach the basics of both Kotlin and Android. We’re currently in the process of creating our “curriculum” and brainstorming our teaching plans. We look forward to providing you with concise and practical content.
